# PRODIGY_CS_03
Built a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provide feedback to users on the password's strength.

## Password Complexity Checker
A simple Python-based command-line tool that checks the strength of a password based on common security criteria such as:
1. Length: Passwords should be at least 8 characters long for optimal security.
2. Uppercase and Lowercase Letters: Mixing uppercase and lowercase letters enhances security.
3. Numbers: Including numbers adds to the complexity of the password.
4. Special Characters: Special characters provide an extra layer of security.

It provides real-time feedback and suggestions to help users create stronger passwords.

### How It Works
The tool evaluates your password and classifies it as:
- Very Strong 
- Strong 
- Moderate
- Weak
- Very Weak

### Features
- Checks password strength based on common criteria
- Provides human-friendly feedback to improve weak passwords
- Easy to run via command-line interface (CLI)
- No external dependencies required

### Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the `password_checker.py` file.
2. Run the script using Python 3.
3. Enter a password when prompted.
4. Receive feedback on the strength of the password.

### Feedback
- For strong passwords, users receive confirmation along with a recommendation to keep the password safe.
- For weak passwords, users receive specific feedback on how to improve their password's strength.
